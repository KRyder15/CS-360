This inventory tracking application was developed to help users efficiently manage and monitor item quantities in real time. The goal of the app was to provide a simple yet effective tool for individuals or small businesses to track their stock, avoid shortages, and stay organized. The app allows users to create an account, log in securely, and add items with specific quantities to a dynamic grid view. From there, they can adjust item counts using intuitive up and down arrows or delete entries entirely. This design addressed the user’s need for a quick, mobile-friendly inventory system that provides immediate visual feedback without unnecessary complexity.

To support these goals, several screens were necessary, including the login and registration screens for user authentication, and the main inventory screen where users could interact directly with their stored data. The user interface was designed with clarity and ease of use in mind. Buttons and icons such as the plus sign, arrows, and trash can were chosen for familiarity and quick recognition. By emphasizing minimalism, contrast, and large touch targets, the layout ensured that users could perform actions comfortably on any mobile device. These design decisions made the interface user-centered, intuitive, and visually clean, helping prevent confusion or accidental inputs.

During the coding process, I approached development incrementally, first implementing user authentication, then adding database interactions, and finally integrating UI elements. I relied on Android Studio’s structure and lifecycle management tools to keep my code modular and maintainable. Event listeners and adapters were used to manage data updates between the interface and the database, ensuring that user actions were reflected immediately. These same strategies—breaking tasks into smaller functional components, keeping code readable, and testing iteratively—can be applied to any future mobile or web project to maintain quality and reduce debugging time.

Testing played a crucial role in validating functionality. I tested each feature within the Android emulator, verifying that new users could register, log in, add items, and update or remove them without errors. I also explored edge cases, such as lowering quantities below a threshold, which prompted SMS permissions as part of a planned alert feature. This process confirmed that the app handled user actions correctly and identified areas for future improvement, such as refining the alert system. Testing not only guaranteed functionality but also revealed how the user experience could be further enhanced.

Throughout the development process, one of the biggest challenges was managing permissions and intent behavior within Android’s manifest file. Android 12 required explicit exported declarations for activities with intent filters, and resolving this issue required research and adaptation to current Android development standards. Overcoming that challenge reinforced the importance of staying current with platform updates and adjusting configurations carefully.

The component that best demonstrates my skills is the main inventory grid and its connection to the underlying logic. It integrates data management, responsive interface design, and user feedback in a seamless way. This feature shows my ability to build interactive and efficient mobile applications that align with both user needs and professional development best practices. Overall, this project reflects a complete cycle of design, implementation, and testing, illustrating how thoughtful planning and adaptability lead to a functional and user-centered mobile app.
